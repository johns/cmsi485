###  I. Bayesian Network Modeling

Include the following in your report:

1.  Capture some output for your report by taking a picture of the network structure (can drag the nodes around to make it prettier).

2.  Look up the PC Structure Learning algorithm and write a short summary on how it orients edges in the network structure.
>  TODO

3.  Explain, using the theory behind this algorithm, why it was able to orient some edges but not others. Reference the graph you found above.
>  TODO


###  II. Decision Network Modeling

In a small paragraph, argue for whether or not you believe this practice should be considered ethical, especially if each individual's characteristics were collected via social media. Compare this practice to targeted political advertising wherein ads are curated based on perceived in-group.
